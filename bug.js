While developing an Expo managed workflow app, I encountered an unusual issue where the app would crash on iOS devices after updating to a specific Expo SDK version. The Android version remained unaffected.  The error messages in the iOS console were vague and unhelpful, offering no clear indication of the root cause.  I had thoroughly tested the update on Android emulators and physical devices and it worked perfectly. The crash occurred consistently on different iOS devices and simulators, suggesting an issue within the Expo SDK's iOS implementation or a possible incompatibility with one of my app's dependencies.
